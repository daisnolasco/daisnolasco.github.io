        My name is Daisy Nolasco im a student at Western Washington University, I plan on majoring
         in computer science and minoring in design. I was born and raised in kirkland washington with my 
         2 siblings. In my free time i enjoy to hangout with friends, go on hikes, play with my 2 cats and work on 
         art.Im really passionate about art, creativity and tech which is why i want to become a front end developer 
         in the future since im able to connect all those passions in one.
