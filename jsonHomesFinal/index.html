    <h1> Architectural House Styles </h1>
    <p>House styles vary widely, reflecting cultural trends, historical influences, and local climates. Popular
      architectural styles include Colonial, with its symmetry and formal design; Victorian, known for ornate details
      and intricate trim; and Craftsman, characterized by hand-crafted woodwork and earthy materials. Mid-century Modern
      homes emphasize clean lines, open spaces, and large windows that blend indoor and outdoor spaces, while
      Ranch-style homes, often single-story, have a sprawling layout that suits suburban settings. Contemporary designs
      are typically minimalist, focusing on sustainability and innovative use of materials, with an emphasis on natural
      light. Each style brings unique features that cater to different tastes and functional needs, making residential
      architecture a rich field of diverse and evolving design traditions.</p>
