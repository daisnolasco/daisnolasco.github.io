       How Does Climate Change Effect Us? </b></h2>
        <section><b>The rate of change since the mid-20th century is unprecedented over millennia.</b>Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era ‚Äî and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth‚Äôs orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.</p>

          Melting sea ice does not affect sea levels, but it does impact global temperatures. Sea ice is light-colored and reflects sunlight back into space; open water is darker and absorbs more sunlight. Warming ocean waters melt sea ice from below, and warmer air helps melt it from above. As ice cover thins and shrinks, more ocean is exposed and less sunlight is reflected, further warming the water and air. Satellites help monitor changes in sea ice which is an area of research for upcoming missions in the Earth Systems Observatory.

        Our ocean is changing. With 70 percent of the planet covered in water,
        the seas are important drivers of the global climate. Yet increasing greenhouse gases from human activities
        are
        altering the ocean before our eyes.
          Rising greenhouse gas concentrations not only warm the air, but the ocean, too.
          Research shows that around 90 percent of the excess heat from global warming is being absorbed by the ocean.
          Ocean
          heat has steadily risen since measurements began in 1955, breaking records in 2023. All this added heat has
          led
          to
          more frequent and intense marine heat waves.</p>

            The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5
            Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era </p>

                  Global sea levels have risen more than 4 inches (101 millimeters) since measurements began in 1992, increasing coastal flooding in some places. As ocean water warms, it expands and takes up more space. The added heat in the air and ocean is also melting ice sheets and glaciers, which adds freshwater to the ocean and further raises sea levels. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, launched in 2022, and Sentinel 6 Michael Freilich, launched in 2020, are providing unparalleled views of sea level rise on top of decades of data from other missions.
