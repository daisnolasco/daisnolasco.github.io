    <h1>On Saturday Oct 26, 2024, I spent 24 hours away from my phone and this is how it went:</h1>
</div>


 
 <p>Unplugging for a full 24hrs is something I always wanted to try so after hearing that is was our assignment for this week I was more than excited to spend 24 hours away from my screen and my roommates were more than happy to join me for this challenge. </p>
 <p>Prior to this challenge, I knew I wanted to not only go phone free but also wanted to stay away from my computer and canvas ,in order to give myself the full  experience. The night before, I made sure to complete all my assignment for that day and check my email. I made sure to text my family and close friends that I was doing this challenge just in case they called or texted me. We also planned on carving pumpkins so we printed our designs ahead of time so we would be able to use our phone as inspiration.

 </p>
 <p>The morning of, me and my roommates put our phone on do not disturb and put them on the coffee table while we made breakfast. This is where I  already felt a struggle since I usually like to watch something on my phone while I eat , but it was nice having breakfast all together since our schedules don’t allow that to happen very often. After breakfast, we were all very tempted to go on our phones but instead decided to go on a Saturday morning walk around our neighborhood. We took one phone in case of an emergency, but no one was allowed to go on it of course. This walk was very fun since we got to see all the Halloween décor and got to pet some really cute dogs. On our way back from our walk we decided to go to the park right next to our apartment and sat at the table and where we talked for a bit , it was really refreshing being able to just talk as friends with no phone in sight, that we were at  the park for  way longer then we planned on  where we even played around on the monkey bars and slide since it was so empty.</p>
<p>After the park we got back to our apartment super motivated to carve pumpkins after seeing all the fun Halloween decorations and pumpkins on our walk. We drove to Fred Meyer and picked up 4 pumpkins, we also invited our upstairs neighbors to join us for pumpkin carving but  the only difference was that we had to use our printed sheets to draw our designs while they used their phones, but luckily, they were able to take a picture of all our pumpkins. After pumpkin carving, we were really tempted to watch a movie on the tv but we have been going so strong without any screens that we ended the night with monopoly.</p>
<p>Overall I think everyone should try to be off their phone for a full day, me and my roommates are very happy that we did it , in a way it made me feel more productive and It was so nice to be in the moment . I definitely say this challenge was a lot easier to do if you  have people doing it with you since we won’t be tempted to go your phone as much and it creates a stronger bond.</p>
