            <h3>The main components of the internet:</h3>

            <p><b>Servers:</b>
                Servers are the computers that provide services or share stored resources with the client
                devices.Their main job is to comply with client requests by providing the requested information or
                performing the requested tasks.
                .</p>
            <p> <b>Internet protocols:</b>
                To retrieve the required data on the internet, a set of guidelines and procedures known as
            </p>

            <p> <b>IP addresses:</b>
                IP addresses are used to identify devices on the internet. These can include IPv4 addresses such
                as 192.168.1.1, which is the default IP address many router manufacturers use to access a router's
                interface.
                .</p>
            <p><b>Routers: </b>Routers forward data packets between computer networks. By using routing tables,
                routers determine the best routes or paths for data transfer between devices.</p>
            <p><b>Domain name system</b>DNS converts human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into
                machine-readable IP addresses.</p>

            <p><b>Firewalls and security measures:</b>Incoming and outgoing network traffic on the internet is monitored
                and controlled by different types of security firewalls and security measures. Firewalls safeguard
                networks and devices against unauthorized internet access, cyber threats and malicious activities.</p>

                    <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
                    <p>The internet, sometimes simply called the net, is a worldwide system
                        of
                        interconnected computer networks and
                        electronic devices that communicate with each other using an established set of protocols.
                        The internet was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S.
                        government in 1969. ARPA was later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
                        in 1972. DARPA's first known packet-switching network was known as the Advanced Research
                        Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). The original goal was to create a network that would let
                        users of a research computer at one university talk to research computers at other universities.
                        A side benefit of ARPANET's design was that because messages could be routed or rerouted in more
                        than one direction, the network could continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in
                        the event of a military attack or other disaster.

                    <h2>Difference between the World Wide Web and the internet:</h2>
                    <p>The key difference between the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW or web) is that the internet
                        is a
                        global
                        connection of networks, while the web is a collection of information or websites that can be
                        accessed using
                        the
                        internet. In other words, the internet is the infrastructure and the web is a service on top of
                        it.

                        The web is the most widely used part of the internet. Its outstanding feature is hypertext, a
                        method
                        of
                        instantly cross-referencing text. Used in blog posts, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) web
                        pages,
                        social
                        media
                        posts and online shopping websites, hypertext appears in a different color than the rest of the
                        text
                        and is
                        often also underlined. When a user clicks on one of these words or phrases, they're transferred
                        to
                        the
                        related
                        site or webpage. Buttons, images or portions of images are also used as hyperlinks.

                    <h2>History of the internet:</h2>

                    <p>In 1983, the ARPANET began using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
                        open networking protocol suite and in 1985, the National Science Foundation Network designed the
                        network to connect university computer science departments around the U.S.

                        Communications over the internet greatly improved in 1989 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                        (HTTP) was created, enabling different computer platforms to connect to the same internet sites.
                        In 1993, the Mosaic web browser was created.

                        The internet continues to grow and evolve. Internet Protocol Version 6, for example, was
                        designed to anticipate enormous future expansion in the number of available IP addresses. In a
                        related development, the internet of things (IoT) is the burgeoning environment in which almost
                        any entity or object can be given a unique identifier (UID) and the ability to transfer data
                        automatically over the internet.</p>
                </div>
               


                <div class="grid1">

                    <h2>How the internet works:</h2>
                    <p>Every device attempting to access the internet is initially linked either physically through
                        cables or wirelessly. For instance, a computer can establish a physical connection to a modem
                        using an Ethernet cable or connect wirelessly through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals.
                        Each computer connected to the internet is also assigned a unique IP address that enables the
                        device to be recognized. </p>
                    <p>When one device attempts to send a message to another device, the data is sent over the internet
                        in the form of packets and each packet is assigned a port number that will connect it to its
                        endpoint.</p>
                    <p> A packet that has both a unique IP address and port number can be translated from alphabetic
                        text into electronic signals by traveling through the layers of the Open Systems Interconnection
                        (OSI) model from the top application layer to the bottom physical layer.
                        The message is then sent over the internet where it's received by the internet service
                        provider's (ISP) router.
                        The router examines the destination address assigned to each packet and determines where to send
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, the packet reaches the client and travels in reverse from the bottom physical layer
                        of the OSI model to the top application layer. During this process, the routing data -- the port
                        number and IP address -- is stripped from the packet, thus enabling the data to be translated
                        back into alphabetic text and completing the transmission process.In general, the internet can be used to communicate across large or small distances, share information from any place in the world, and access information or answers to almost any question in momentsAdditionally, there's an element of the internet called the dark web. The dark web is hidden and inaccessible through standard browsers. Instead, it uses the Tor and I2P browsers which let users remain completely anonymous. While this anonymity can be a great way to protect an online user's security and free speech, or for the government to keep classified data hidden, the dark web also creates an environment that facilitates cybercrime, the transfer of illegal goods and terrorism..</p>
